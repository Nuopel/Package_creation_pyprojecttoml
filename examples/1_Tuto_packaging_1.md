### Step-by-Step Guide: Beginner creation package, Explaining the basic files :

#### The minimal Package Structure:
Provide a detailed code block for creating the initial directory structure using terminal commands.

#### add a function and call it into the package and call it into a program. 


### Step-by-Step Guide: Intermediate creation package, adding tests and examples :

#### Writing Tests:
Code snippet for a simple test case using `pytest` for the RMS function in `module0.py`.

#### Package Distribution:
Screenshot of the terminal showing the commands used for packaging and a diagram illustrating the distribution process on PyPI.

### 4. Interactive Examples

#### Usage Example:
Provide a complete code snippet of `examples/example.py` demonstrating the package's functionality. Encourage trying different inputs and observing the output.



### Visual Aids to Include:

- **Diagrams**: Use tools like draw.io to create diagrams explaining concepts and workflows.
- **Screenshots**: Take screenshots of your IDE showing the package structure, example code, and terminal commands.
- **Code Snippets**: Use Markdown code blocks to present code snippets throughout the tutorial for clarity and easy copying.

By integrating these elements, your tutorial will not only be informative but also engaging, providing a hands-on learning experience. Encourage readers to experiment and explore beyond the tutorial to deepen their understanding of Python packages.
